# iCVMapp3r

*iCVMapp3r* (pronounced icvmapper) is a CNN-based algorithm for brain extraction (skull-stripping)
using MRI images from BrainLab.
It can deal with brains with lesions and extensive atrophy and extracts the brain in seconds.
It can use a T1-weighted image or a combination of T1, T2 and Flair scans as input.
